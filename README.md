Users take a survey over their food ideas and preferences. This is entered into a premade array and compared with other users already in the array. This is displayed to the user as their new B. F. F. (Best Foodie Friend).

The website is made with html, css, bootstrap, javascript, node, express, body parser, uses javascript validation and takes advantage of AJAX calls.

The users survey data is entered into the array and is available for comparison with when new users take the survey.
